# Feature_Importance

Feature importance means assigning scores to input features using a predictive model; the scores signify the relative importance of the features for making a prediction. In this notebook, Coefficient of Determination, Predictive Power Score, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM) are applied to quantify the importance of input features to predict targets. Finally, majority vote technique is considered to integrate all these predictive algorithms to find the most and least important features. Both Regression and Classification problems are applied in this study. 

Python functions and data files to run this notebook are in my [Github](https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/Feature_Importance.git) page.
